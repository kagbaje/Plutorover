### My Approach to the Problem
I made use of Vectors for my solution  as I 
could easily express forward/backward movement by displacement
 along a coordinate system.
Left and Right commands were also implemented using matrix multiplication by rotating a vector on a point 
 90 degrees anticlockwise and clockwise respectively.	Vectors also proved helpful in implementing a spheric planet and obstacle detection.

### Further improvements
# Implement user interface
# Make it more object oriented, However i was restricted due to the use of structs.
# Add other features to my robot such as speed and feedback
